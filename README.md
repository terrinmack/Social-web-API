## Description

##  Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a social network API
- WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
- THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
- WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
- THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
- WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
- WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
- THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have mongoDB installed. Have Insomnia installed as well for ease.
2. Within the terminal, run `npm install` if the package.json file is present.
3. If the package.json file is not present, run the following commands:
- npm init -y
- npm install express
- npm install mongoose
4. Start the server using `npm start`
5. Open Insomnia and enter the localhost url to test api routes
